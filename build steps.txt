Create using React.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and JavaScript, to accomplish the core functionality of the "TapMe" task.

Step-by-Step Implementation:
Step 1: Setup Telegram Bot (30 minutes)

Create a Telegram bot using BotFather (https://t.me/botfather):

Follow the BotFather instructions to create a new bot and obtain the bot token.
Set up the bot with a simple /start command to initiate the game and handle commands.
Handle commands with Express.js:

Use the Telegram Bot API's webhook or long polling to listen for commands like /start.
Store user information (Telegram ID, username) when they first interact with the bot.
Example:

javascript
const TelegramBot = require('node-telegram-bot-api');
const bot = new TelegramBot(token, { polling: true });

bot.onText(/\/start/, (msg) => {
  // Store user info in the database
  // Respond to the user
  bot.sendMessage(msg.chat.id, 'Welcome to TapMe!');
});

Step 2: Frontend Development (React.js - 3 hours)
1.Set up a React project:
2.Create the Tap Button: Design a simple button component where users can tap to earn coins.

4.Real-time Updates:

Use setInterval() or WebSocket for real-time updates between the client and server (e.g., retrieving the latest coin balance).
Responsive Design:

5.Then deploy to Vercel or Netlify

Step 3: Backend Development (Express.js & MongoDB - 2 hours)
1.Set up an Express server:
2.Set up MongoDB:Store user data and their coin balances in MongoDB.
3.GraphQL Alternative (Optional):If you’re comfortable, you can set up GraphQL using express-graphql, but REST-based API endpoints will work just fine for this small project.

Step 4: Integration (1-2 hours)
1.Frontend-Backend Integration:Use Axios or fetch to connect your React frontend with your Express backend.Every time a user taps the button, send an API request to update the user's coin balance in MongoDB.
2.Telegram Bot Integration:Ensure the bot updates the user’s balance when they use the /start command by sending the initial balance from the database.
